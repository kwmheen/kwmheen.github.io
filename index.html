        <h2>Brief Bio</h2>
        <p>I am a masterâ€™s student in Human-Centered Interactive Technologies Laboratory at the Graduate School of Culture Technology, KAIST under the supervision of Prof. Sang Ho Yoon. I received a B.S. in Engineering degree from Hanyang University. My research interests lie in gaze-based behavior prediction and gaze-hand multimodal interaction. I am particularly fascinated by how eye movements can be used to anticipate user intentions and enhance interactive systems. Additionally, I explore the integration of gaze tracking with hand gestures to create more intuitive and seamless human-computer interactions. Through my work, I aim to contribute to the development of technologies that bridge the gap between human cognitive processes and interactive systems, ultimately improving user experience and accessibility.</p>
        <p>During my undergraduate studies, I worked as a Research Assistant (2022.03.~Present) under professor Youngjoon Won, and as an undergraduate researcher (2022.06.~2022.08.) at Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)â€™s Intelligent Robotics Research Center.</p>
